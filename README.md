Wanderer, but this time it's a website

## Description
In grade 10, I figured out how to use the programming capabilities of my TI-83 graphing calculator and starting making games during math and science classes. I started out with a simple one player pong games and eventually made Wanderer. Wanderer is an RPG where you explored a randomly generated world full of mountains, hills, forests, towns and ruins to explore. Moving off an edge of the visible map generated a new map and placed the player on the opposite edge. It was ~200KB of TI-BASIC's LBLs and GOTOs and IF-THEN-ENDs and matrices for data storage.

And I've used it as a project idea for (almost) every new programming language I've worked with since.

the WDD refers to the web design and development class this project is for
